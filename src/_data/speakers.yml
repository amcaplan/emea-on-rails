  title: "The Trail to Scale Without Fail: Rails?"
  abstract: |-
    Let's be blunt: Most web apps aren’t so computation-heavy and won't hit scaling issues.
    What if yours is the exception? Can Rails handle it?
    Cue Exhibit A: Cloudinary, which serves billions of image and video requests daily, including on-the-fly edits, QUICKLY, running on Rails since Day 1. Case closed?
    Not so fast. Beyond the app itself, we needed creative solutions to ensure that, as traffic rises and falls at the speed of the internet, we handle the load gracefully, and no customer overwhelms the system.
    The real question isn't whether Rails is up to the challenge, but rather: Are you?

  title: Self-Care on Rails
  abstract: |-
    This past year has been one of the most challenging years in recent memory. The pandemic has taken a toll, including on children.
    Adults used their professional skills to help make the year a little better for the kids in our lives: Therapists counseled, entertainers delighted, teachers educated... and Rails developers developed!
    In this talk, I'll share the apps I built on Rails that helped my kids and me cope, celebrate and persevere through the year.
    In 2020, tech was pivotal in keeping us going, and for my kids, Rails made the year a little more manageable.

  title: "API Optimization Tale: Monitor, Fix and Deploy (on Friday)"
  abstract: |-
    I saw a green build on a Friday afternoon. I knew I need to push it to production before the weekend. My gut told me it was a trap. I had already stayed late to revert a broken deploy. I knew the risk.
    In the middle of a service extraction project, we decided to migrate from REST to GraphQL and optimize API usage. My deploy was a part of this radical change.
    Why was I deploying so late? How did we measure the migration effects? And why was I testing on production? I'll tell you a tale of small steps, monitoring, and old tricks in a new setting. Hope, despair, and broken production included.

    Mentorship in software development carries a lot of responsibility, but plays an integral part in making tech communities as well as individuals thrive.
    In this talk, we'll go over some of my mentorship experiences, adopting techniques and learning to teach, so we can teach to learn. Anyone can be a great mentor!

  title: Beautiful reactive web UIs, Ruby and you
  abstract: |-
    A lot of life changing things have happened in 2020. And I'm obviously speaking about Stimulus Reflex and Hotwire and how we as Rails devs are finally enabled to skip a lot of JS while implementing reactive web UIs. But what if I told you, there's room for even more developer happiness? Imagine crafting beautiful UIs in pure Ruby, utilizing a library reaching from simple UI components representing basic HTML tags over styled UI concepts based on Bootstrap to something like a collection, rendering reactive data sets. Beautiful, reactive web UIs implemented in pure Ruby are waiting for you!
  bio: |-
    Jonas is a self-employed software developer. For years he struggled with increasing complexity of web app development caused by adding a JS frontend application instead of using the UI layer of Rails. He decided to fight against this complexity and created Matestack enabling Rails developers to implement reactive UIs in pure Ruby while enjoying highest developer happiness. Speaking of happiness: In his spare time he enjoys a good coffee and memes of funny dogs (and sometimes cats).
